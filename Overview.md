Hardware Components
Pill storage compartments: Separate containers for each medication to prevent cross-contamination. Use slanted plates to ensure pills slide down into dispensing tubes.
Dispensing mechanism: A rotating cylinder with a hole that allows one pill to drop into a delivery tube when rotated. The delivery tube should have a sensor to detect if the pill has been dispensed.
Biometric sensors: Incorporate facial recognition camera and fingerprint scanner for user authentication.
User interface: Include buttons, a display screen, and speakers for alerts and reminders.

Software Features
Medication scheduling: Allow users to input their medication regimens, including dosages and timing. Generate personalized reminders for each dose.
Dispensing control: Program the rotating cylinder to dispense the correct pill at the scheduled times. Verify dispensing with the delivery tube sensor.
Authentication: Implement facial recognition and fingerprint matching algorithms to ensure only authorized users can receive medications.
Tracking and reporting: Log all dispensing activity and allow users to view their medication history. Enable reports to be shared with caregivers and doctors.
Remote monitoring: Provide a companion mobile app that allows family or healthcare providers to monitor adherence and receive alerts.
